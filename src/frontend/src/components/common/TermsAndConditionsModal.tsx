            <br />
            Welcome to SRV! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your
            access to and use of the SRV website, mobile application, and
            related services (collectively, the "Platform"). The Platform is
            owned and operated by SRV, a platform based in Baguio City,
            Philippines.
            <br />
            <br />
            By creating an account, accessing, or using our Platform, you
            acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
            these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any other guidelines posted on
            the Platform. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use
            the Platform.
            <br />
            <br />
            This agreement is a legally binding electronic contract between you
            ("User," "you," "your") and SRV ("SRV," "we," "us," "our"), in
            accordance with the Republic Act No. 8792, also known as the
            E-Commerce Act of 2000.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>1. Definitions</strong>
            <br />
            Platform: Refers to the SRV website and mobile application.
            <br />
            User: Any individual who creates an account on the Platform,
            including Clients and Service Providers.
            <br />
            Client: A User who requests, books, and receives services from a
            Service Provider.
            <br />
            Service Provider (or Provider): A User who offers and performs
            services for Clients.
            <br />
            Service: The specific work or task performed by a Provider for a
            Client as listed on the Platform.
            <br />
            Commission Fee: The service fee charged by SRV to the Provider for
            the use of the Platform, calculated as a percentage of the total
            Service price.
            <br />
            Outstanding Commission: The cumulative, running balance of unpaid
            Commission Fees owed by a Provider to the Platform. This is a
            measure of debt and is not electronic money.
            <br />
            Commission Credit Limit: The maximum allowable Outstanding
            Commission a Provider may accrue before their ability to accept new
            jobs is automatically and temporarily restricted.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>2. The Platform's Role</strong>
            <br />
            SRV is a technology platform that connects Clients seeking services
            with independent Service Providers who can provide those services.
            You acknowledge that:
            <br />
            SRV is not an employer of Service Providers. Providers are
            independent contractors.
            <br />
            SRV is not a direct party to the agreements made between Clients and
            Providers.
            <br />
            SRV does not directly perform the Services and is not responsible
            for the quality, timing, legality, or any aspect of the Services
            provided, except as explicitly stated in these Terms. Our role is
            limited to facilitating the connection and providing the features
            described herein.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>3. User Accounts and Eligibility</strong>
            <br />
            Eligibility: To use the Platform, you must be at least 18 years old
            and have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts.
            <br />
            Account Registration: You agree to provide accurate, current, and
            complete information during the registration process and to update
            such information to keep it accurate.
            <br />
            Account Security: You are solely responsible for safeguarding your
            account password and for all activities that occur under your
            account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of
            your account.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>4. Financial Terms for Service Providers</strong>
            <br />
            This section governs the financial relationship between Service
            Providers and the Platform.
            <br />
            Cash Payments: The primary method of payment for Services is a
            direct cash payment from the Client to the Service Provider upon
            completion of the Service. The Platform does not process these
            payments.
            <br />
            Commission Fee: In consideration for the use of the Platform, the
            Provider agrees to pay SRV a Commission Fee for each completed job
            booked through the Platform. The applicable percentage will be
            displayed to the Provider before they accept a job.
            <br />
            Accrual of Outstanding Commission: Upon confirmation that a
            cash-based job is complete, the Platform will automatically
            calculate the Commission Fee and add this amount to the Provider's
            Outstanding Commission balance. This is an automated accounting of
            debt owed to the Platform.
            <br />
            Payment of Outstanding Commission: Providers are obligated to settle
            their Outstanding Commission balance regularly. Payments shall be
            made via GCash to the official company account specified within the
            Platform. Providers must submit proof of payment (e.g., a
            transaction receipt screenshot) through the designated in-app upload
            facility for verification.
            <br />
            Commission Credit Limit: The Platform enforces a Commission Credit
            Limit (e.g., â‚±500.00). If a Provider's Outstanding Commission meets
            or exceeds this limit, their account will be automatically and
            temporarily restricted from accepting new job requests. This
            restriction will be lifted automatically once their Outstanding
            Commission is paid and verified, bringing their balance below the
            limit. By using the Platform, you explicitly agree to this condition
            as a fundamental part of the service.
            <br />
            Disputes: Any disputes regarding commission calculations must be
            raised through the Platform's support channels within seven (7) days
            of the transaction.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>5. User Obligations and Conduct</strong>
